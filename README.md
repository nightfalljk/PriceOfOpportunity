# The Price of Opportunity 

This is the source code for the game "The Price of Opportunity".

The game was developed during the Science, Technology and Society game jam at the Technical University of Munich.

The goal of the game jam was to create a game highlighting the issues faced by coca farmers in South America who often have no real alternative but to cultivate coca if they want to survive.
The game is similar to a city builder where players manage a farm in South America. Players can choose whether they want to abide by the law and grow legal crops only or whether they want to cultivate the illegal, but much more profitable coca plant. Depending on their choices they might not make ends meet or run into serious trouble with the government.

### Personal Contributions

On this project I was responsible for coding all of our game's functionality.

- Implemented a player controller to allow players to move the camera, build buildings, hire workers, or buy and sell resources
- Implemented a simple worker and resource simulation where workers work in buildings and provide labor to create resources
- Implemented an event system that allowed us to trigger narrative events depending on player actions. Events in turn would also influence workers and resources
